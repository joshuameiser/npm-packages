## Component library based on my React template

This npm package contains my personal component library, with my [React template](https://github.com/joshuameiser/React-Template) as a base.
All components in this package are designed with the thought, that my template was used as a base for the project. Therefore all colors are
defined as css variables in this package. They should contain as little manual tweaking upon use as possible.

There is no hosting for the component playground just yet.

## Purpose of this library

The main purpose of this library is for me to practise creating new components, documenting them and making them reusable within all of my projects that use my template as a base.

Additionally, it can serve as a part of my portfolio - once it is filled up with more components.
